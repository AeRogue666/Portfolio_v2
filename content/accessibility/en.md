# Accessibility statement

``Updated 2026/02/02.``

This website is a personal portfolio designed to showcase my projects, background, and skills, with a strong focus on digital accessibility.

## My commitment

I aim to make this site **accessible to as many people as possible**, regardless of ability, device, or context of use. Accessibility is not a constraint for me, but a **professional responsibility** and a quality standard.

## Conformance status

This website has not yet undergone a formal accessibility audit against WCAG or RGAA standards.

However, several accessibility best practices have been implemented from the design phase:

- Clear semantic HTML structure (header", "main", "article", "section", footer')
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Visible focus indicators
- Adjustable text size
- Contrast modes, grayscale mode, and readable fonts
- Text alternatives for meaningful images
- Properly defined document language

## Known limitations

Despite these efforts, some limitations may remain, including:
Visual content still being improved (images, fine contrast adjustments)
No complete automated manual audit at this stage
Third-party components whose accessibility depends on external libraries
These issues are part of the planned improvement roadmap.

## Reporting an issue

If you encounter an accessibility issue or a bug, you can report it via the dedicated page:
***/report**

Every feedback helps Improve the experience for everyone.

## Continuous improvement

This site evolves regularly.

User feedback, manual testing, and audit tools (Lighthouse, axe, screen readers) are part of my continuous improvement process.

Thank you for visiting.
