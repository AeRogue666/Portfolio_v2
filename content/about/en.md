# About

I am a France-based full-stack developer specialized in accessibility and scalable web architecture.

I help teams design and build inclusive, maintainable and performance-oriented web applications without sacrificing user-experience or design, using Vue, Nuxt, Typescript and modern backend tooling such as Node.js, Prisma, Express and PostgreSQL.

My approach combines:

- Accessibility-first thinking (WCAG-driven)
- User-centered design principles
- Clean and scalable architecture
- Long-term maintainability

Accessibility isn't a feature.
It is a foundation.

A digital product should be **clear**, **usable**, and **robust**, regardless of context or constraints.

I prioritize web standards over passing trends, and long-term reliability over shor-term convenience.

---

This portfolio itself reflects that philosophy.
It is both a showcase and an experimental space - a living platform where I explore architecture, accessibility and content-driven design.
It evolves continuously, alongside my skills and experience.

If your team values clarity, performance and inclusive digital experiences, we should talk.
