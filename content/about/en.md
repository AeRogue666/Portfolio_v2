# About

I am full-stack developer with a strong interest in accessibility, interface quality and user experience.

My approach is user-centered:

- A product should be **clear**, **usable**, and **robust**, regardless of context or constraints.

I mainly work with modern stack (Nuxt, TypeScript, Node, PostgreSQL), and pay close attention to:

- Code readability
- Maintenability
- Accessibility from the design phase

Prioritizing web standards over passing trends.

This portfolio is both a showcase and an experimental space.
It evolves continuously, alongside my skills.
